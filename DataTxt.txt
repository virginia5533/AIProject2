as is typical of an indo european language  english follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment  unlike other indo european languages though  english has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favour of analytic constructions  only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class  english distinguishes at least seven major word classes  verbs  nouns  adjectives  adverbs  determiners  including articles   prepositions  and conjunctions  some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns  and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators  and add the class of interjections       english also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs  such as have and do  expressing the categories of mood and aspect  questions are marked by do support  wh movement  fronting of question words beginning with wh   and word order inversion with some verbs        some traits typical of germanic languages persist in english  such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut  i e  changing the vowel of the stem  as in the pairs speak spoke and foot feet  and weak stems inflected through affixation  such as love loved  hand hands        vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system  he him  who whom  and in the inflection of the copula verb to be        the seven word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence        the	chairman	of	the	committee	and	the	loquacious	politician	clashed	violently	when	the	meeting	started  det 	noun	prep 	det 	noun	conj 	det 	adj 	noun	verb	advb 	conj 	det 	noun	verb nouns and noun phrases main article  english nouns english nouns are only inflected for number and possession  new nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding  they are semantically divided into proper nouns  names  and common nouns  common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns  and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns        most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix  s  but a few nouns have irregular plural forms  mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier  e g  one loaf of bread  two loaves of bread        regular plural formation   singular  cat  dog plural  cats  dogs irregular plural formation   singular  man  woman  foot  fish  ox  knife  mouse plural  men  women  feet  fish  oxen  knives  mice possession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic  s  also traditionally called a genitive suffix   or by the preposition of  historically the  s possessive has been used for animate nouns  whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns  today this distinction is less clear  and many speakers use  s also with inanimates  orthographically the possessive  s is separated from a singular noun with an apostrophe  if the noun is plural formed with  s the apostrophe follows the  s        possessive constructions   with  s  the woman s husband s child with of  the child of the husband of the woman nouns can form noun phrases  nps  where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners  quantifiers  conjunctions or adjectives       noun phrases can be short  such as the man  composed only of a determiner and a noun  they can also include modifiers such as adjectives  e g  red  tall  all  and specifiers such as determiners  e g  the  that   but they can also tie together several nouns into a single long np  using conjunctions such as and  or prepositions such as with  e g  the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles  this np uses conjunctions  prepositions  specifiers  and modifiers   regardless of length  an np functions as a syntactic unit       for example  the possessive enclitic can  in cases which do not lead to ambiguity  follow the entire noun phrase  as in the president of india s wife  where the enclitic follows india and not president   the class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness  where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one  a definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor  whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known  quantifiers  which include one  many  some and all  are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number  the noun must agree with the number of the determiner  e g  one man  sg   but all men  pl    determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase        adjectives main article  english adjectives english adjectives are words such as good  big  interesting  and canadian that most typically modify nouns  denoting characteristics of their referents  e g   a red car   as modifiers  they come before the nouns they modify and after determiners       english adjectives also function as predicative complements  e g   the child is happy    in modern english  adjectives are not inflected so as to agree in form with the noun they modify  as adjectives in most other indo european languages do  for example  in the phrases the slender boy  and many slender girls  the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun   some adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison  with the positive degree unmarked  the suffix  er marking the comparative  and  est marking the superlative  a small boy  the boy is smaller than the girl  that boy is the smallest  some adjectives have irregular suppletive comparative and superlative forms  such as good  better  and best  other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions  with the adverb more marking the comparative  and most marking the superlative  happier or more happy  the happiest or most happy       there is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison  and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form        determiners main article  english determiners english determiners are words such as the  each  many  some  and which  occurring most typically in noun phrases before the head nouns and any modifiers and marking the noun phrase as definite or indefinite       they often agree with the noun in number  they do not typically inflect for degree of comparison   pronouns  case  and person main article  english pronouns english pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection  the personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons  i me  he him  she her  we us  they them  as well as an animateness distinction in the third person singular  distinguishing it from the three sets of animate third person singular pronouns  and an optional gender distinction in the animate third person singular  distinguishing between she her  feminine   they them  epicene   and he him  masculine              the subjective case corresponds to the old english nominative case  and the objective case is used in the sense both of the previous accusative case  for a patient  or direct object of a transitive verb   and of the old english dative case  for a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb             the subjective is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause  otherwise the objective is used       while grammarians such as henry sweet      and otto jespersen      noted that the english cases did not correspond to the traditional latin based system  some contemporary grammars  for example huddleston   pullum         retain traditional labels for the cases  calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively   possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms  the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun  as in my chair   while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun  e g  the chair is mine        the english system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address  the old second person singular familiar pronoun thou acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned    both the second and third persons share pronouns between the plural and singular   plural and singular are always identical  you  your  yours  in the second person  except in the reflexive form  yourself yourselves  in most dialects  some dialects have introduced innovative second person plural pronouns  such as y all  found in southern american english and african american  vernacular  english   youse  found in australian english   or ye  in hiberno english   in the third person  the they them series of pronouns  they  them  their  theirs  themselves  are used in both plural and singular  and are the only pronouns available for the plural  in the singular  the they them series  sometimes with the addition of the singular specific reflexive form themself  serve as a gender neutral set of pronouns  these pronouns are becoming more accepted as part of the lgbt culture                 english personal pronouns person	subjective case	objective case	dependent possessive	independent possessive	reflexive  st

pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situationâ€”for example  the pronoun i identifies the speaker  and the pronoun you  the addressee  anaphoric pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience  for example in the sentence i already told you that  the reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase  e g   he sent it to himself  or  she braced herself for impact          prepositions main article  english prepositions prepositional phrases  pp  are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns  e g  with the dog  for my friend  to school  in england       prepositions have a wide range of uses in english  they are used to describe movement  place  and other relations between different entities  but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs       for example  in the phrase i gave it to him  the preposition to marks the recipient  or indirect object of the verb to give  traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded  for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form   with her    to me    for us   but some contemporary grammars such as that of huddleston   pullum          â€“     no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions  rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases  citation needed   verbs and verb phrases main article  english verbs english verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with present tense third person singular subject  only the copula verb to be is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects       auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive  past  or progressive forms  they form complex tenses  aspects  and moods  auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation  and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence             most verbs have six inflectional forms  the primary forms are a plain present  a third person singular present  and a preterite  past  form  the secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive  a gerund participle and a past participle       the copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation  and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject  the first person present tense form is am  the third person singular form is is  and the form are is used in the second person singular and all three plurals  the only verb past participle is been and its gerund participle is being   english inflectional forms inflection	strong	regular plain present	take	love  rd person sg  present	takes	loves preterite	took	loved plain  infinitive 	take	love gerundâ€“participle	taking	loving past participle	taken	loved tense  aspect and mood english has two primary tenses  past  preterite  and non past  the preterite is inflected by using the preterite form of the verb  which for the regular verbs includes the suffix  ed  and for the strong verbs either the suffix  t or a change in the stem vowel  the non past form is unmarked except in the third person singular  which takes the suffix  s        present	preterite first person	i run	i ran second person	you run	you ran third person	john runs	john ran english does not have future verb forms       the future tense is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall       many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going to   going to future          future first person	i will run second person	you will run third person	john will run further aspectual distinctions are shown by auxiliary verbs  primarily have and be  which show the contrast between a perfect and non perfect past tense  i have run vs  i was running   and compound tenses such as preterite perfect  i had been running  and present perfect  i have been running         for the expression of mood  english uses a number of modal auxiliaries  such as can  may  will  shall and the past tense forms could  might  would  should  there are also subjunctive and imperative moods  both based on the plain form of the verb  i e  without the third person singular  s   for use in subordinate clauses  e g  subjunctive  it is important that he run every day  imperative run          an infinitive form  that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to  is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause  finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterite form  in clauses with auxiliary verbs  they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause       for example  he has to go where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive  or in a complement clause such as i saw him leave  where the main verb is see  which is in a preterite form  and leave is in the infinitive   phrasal verbs english also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs  verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle that follows the verb  the phrase then functions as a single predicate  in terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb  but in writing it is written as a separate word  examples of phrasal verbs are to get up  to ask out  to back up  to give up  to get together  to hang out  to put up with  etc  the phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement  e g  lay off meaning terminate someone s employment        in spite of the idiomatic meaning  some grammarians  including huddleston   pullum             do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term  phrasal verb   instead  they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement  i e  he woke up in the morning and he ran up in the mountains are syntactically equivalent   adverbs main article  english adverbs the function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs       many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix  ly  for example  in the phrase the woman walked quickly  the adverb quickly is derived in this way from the adjective quick  some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms  such as good  which has the adverbial form well   syntax  in the english sentence the cat sat on the mat  the subject is the cat  a noun phrase   the verb is sat  and on the mat is a prepositional phrase composed of a noun phrase the mat headed by the preposition on  the tree describes the structure of the sentence  modern english syntax language is moderately analytic       it has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning  auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions  negative polarity  the passive voice and progressive aspect   basic constituent order english word order has moved from the germanic verb second  v   word order to being almost exclusively subjectâ€“verbâ€“object  svo        the combination of svo order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence  such as he had hoped to try to open it   in most sentences  english only marks grammatical relations through word order       the subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it  the example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb   the dog	bites	the man s	v	o the man	bites	the dog s	v	o an exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun  in which case it is doubly marked  both by word order and by case inflection  where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form  and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form       the example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject are represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun   he	hit	him s	v	o indirect objects  io  of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction  s v io o   such as i gave jane the book or in a prepositional phrase  such as i gave the book to jane        clause syntax main article  english clause syntax in english a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses  that may  in turn  be composed of one or more phrases  e g  noun phrases  verb phrases  and prepositional phrases   a clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents  such as any nps and pps  within a sentence  there is always at least one main clause  or matrix clause  whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause  subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause  for example  in the phrase i think  that  you are lying  the main clause is headed by the verb think  the subject is i  but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause  that  you are lying  the subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause  but it is often omitted       relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause  for example  in the sentence i saw the letter that you received today  the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter  the object of the main clause  relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who  whose  whom and which as well as by that  which can also be omitted        in contrast to many other germanic languages there are no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses        auxiliary verb constructions main articles  do support  english auxiliary verbs  and subjectâ€“auxiliary inversion english syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense  aspect  and mood  auxiliary verbs form main clauses  and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb  for example  in the sentence the dog did not find its bone  the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not  subjectâ€“auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions  including focus  negation  and interrogative constructions   the verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences  where it usually serves to add emphasis  as in  i did shut the fridge   however  in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above  it is used because the rules of english syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present  modern english does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb  as in  i know notâ€”it can only be added to an auxiliary  or copular  verb  hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required  the auxiliary do is used  to produce a form like i do not  don t  know  the same applies in clauses requiring inversion  including most questionsâ€”inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb  so it is not possible to say  know you him   grammatical rules require do you know him        negation is done with the adverb not  which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb  a contracted form of not  n t can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be  just as with questions  many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do support  thus in modern english i don t know him is the correct answer to the question do you know him   but not  i know him not  although this construction may be found in older english        passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs  a passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase  and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase  they are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get  although not all varieties of english allow the use of passives with get  for example  putting the sentence she sees him into the passive becomes he is seen  by her   or he gets seen  by her         questions both yesâ€“no questions and wh questions in english are mostly formed using subjectâ€“auxiliary inversion  am i going tomorrow   where can we eat    which may require do support  do you like her   where did he go    in most cases  interrogative words  wh words  e g  what  who  where  when  why  how  appear in a fronted position  for example  in the question what did you see   the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence   when the wh word is the subject or forms part of the subject  no inversion occurs  who saw the cat    prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question s theme  e g  to whose house did you go last night   the personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case  with the variant whom serving as the objective case form  although this form may be going out of use in many contexts        discourse level syntax while english is a subject prominent language  at the discourse level it tends to use a topic comment structure  where the known information  topic  precedes the new information  comment   because of the strict svo syntax  the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence  in cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence  it is often promoted to subject position through syntactic means  one way of doing this is through a passive construction  the girl was stung by the bee  another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there  e g  it was the girl that the bee stung  there was a girl who was stung by a bee       dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs  e g   it is raining  or in existential clauses  there are many cars on the street   through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects  english is able to maintain both a topic comment sentence structure and a svo syntax   focus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence  generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent  for example  the girl was stung by a bee  emphasising it was a bee and not  for example  a wasp that stung her   or the girl was stung by a bee  contrasting with another possibility  for example that it was the boy        topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation  either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause  for example  that girl over there  she was stung by a bee  emphasises the girl by preposition  but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition  she was stung by a bee  that girl over there  where reference to the girl is established as an  afterthought         cohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora  e g  that is exactly what i mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors  or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event        discourse markers such as oh  so or well  also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion  discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences  discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said  for example  no way is that true   the idiomatic marker no way  expressing disbelief   or boy  i m hungry  the marker boy expressing emphasis   while discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of english  they are also used in written and formal registers        vocabulary see also  foreign language influences in english it is generally stated that english has around         words  or         if obsolete words are counted  this estimate is based on the last full edition of the oxford english dictionary from            over half of these words are nouns  a quarter adjectives  and a seventh verbs  there is one count that puts the english vocabulary at about   million wordsâ€”but that count presumably includes words such as latin species names  scientific terminology  botanical terms  prefixed and suffixed words  jargon  foreign words of extremely limited english use  and technical acronyms        due to its status as an international language  english adopts foreign words quickly  and borrows vocabulary from many other sources  early studies of english vocabulary by lexicographers  the scholars who formally study vocabulary  compile dictionaries  or both  were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good quality linguistic corpora       collections of actual written texts and spoken passages  many statements published before the end of the   th century about the growth of english vocabulary over time  the dates of first use of various words in english  and the sources of english vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available             word formation processes english forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes  one of the most productive processes in english is conversion       using a word with a different grammatical role  for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun  another productive word formation process is nominal compounding            producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick       a process more common in old english than in modern english  but still productive in modern english  is the use of derivational suffixes   hood   ness   ing   ility  to derive new words from existing words  especially those of germanic origin  or stems  especially for words of latin or greek origin    formation of new words  called neologisms  based on greek and or latin roots  for example television or optometry  is a highly productive process in english and in most modern european languages  so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated  for this reason  american lexicographer philip gove attributed many such words to the  international scientific vocabulary   isv  when compiling webster s third new international dictionary         another active word formation process in english are acronyms       words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases  e

 derived from proper names      english  besides forming new words from existing words and their roots  also borrows words from other languages  this adoption of words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages  but english has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last       years       the most commonly used words in english are west germanic       the words in english learned first by children as they learn to speak  particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts  are mainly the germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of old english        but one of the consequences of long language contact between french and english in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of english has a very high percentage of  latinate  words  derived from french  especially  and also from other romance languages and latin   french words from various periods of the development of french now make up one third of the vocabulary of english       linguist anthony lacoudre estimated that over        english words are of french origin and may be understood without orthographical change by french speakers       words of old norse origin have entered the english language primarily from the contact between old norse and old english during colonisation of eastern and northern england  many of these words are part of english core vocabulary  such as egg and knife        english has also borrowed many words directly from latin  the ancestor of the romance languages  during all stages of its development            many of these words had earlier been borrowed into latin from greek  latin or greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences  philosophy  and mathematics       english continues to gain new loanwords and calques   loan translations   from languages all over the world  and words from languages other than the ancestral anglo saxon language make up about     of the vocabulary of english        english has formal and informal speech registers  informal registers  including child directed speech  tend to be made up predominantly of words of anglo saxon origin  while the percentage of vocabulary that is of latinate origin is higher in legal  scientific  and academic texts             english loanwords and calques in other languages english has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages            the influence of english comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the english language  the role of english as a world lingua franca  and the large number of books and films that are translated from english into other languages       that pervasive use of english leads to a conclusion in many places that english is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies  among varieties of english  it is especially american english that influences other languages       some languages  such as chinese  write words borrowed from english mostly as calques  while others  such as japanese  readily take in english loanwords written in sound indicating script       dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of english influence on languages in europe       a video game a  is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device  such as a joystick  controller  keyboard  or motion sensing device  to generate visual feedback from a display device  most commonly shown in a video format on a television set  computer monitor  flat panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices  or a virtual reality headset  hence the name  however  not all video games are dependent on graphical outputs  for example  text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype printers  most modern video games are audiovisual  with audio complement delivered through speakers or headphones  and sometimes also with other types of sensory feedback  e g   haptic technology that provides tactile sensations   and some video games also allow microphone and webcam inputs for in game chatting and livestreaming   video games are typically categorized according to their hardware platform  which traditionally includes arcade video games  console games  and computer  pc  games  the latter also encompasses lan games  online games  and browser games  more recently  the video game industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through mobile devices  such as smartphones and tablet computers   virtual and augmented reality systems  and remote cloud gaming  video games are also classified into a wide range of genres based on their style of gameplay and target audience   the first video game prototypes in the     s and     s were simple extensions of electronic games using video like output from large  room sized mainframe computers  the first consumer video game was the arcade video game computer space in       in      came the iconic hit game pong and the first home console  the magnavox odyssey  the industry grew quickly during the  golden age  of arcade video games from the late     s to early     s but suffered from the crash of the north american video game market in      due to loss of publishing control and saturation of the market  following the crash  the industry matured  was dominated by japanese companies such as nintendo  sega  and sony  and established practices and methods around the development and distribution of video games to prevent a similar crash in the future  many of which continue to be followed  in the     s  the core industry centered on  aaa  games  leaving little room for riskier experimental games  coupled with the availability of the internet and digital distribution  this gave room for independent video game development  or  indie games   to gain prominence into the     s  since then  the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing  the emerging asian markets and proliferation of smartphone games in particular are altering player demographics towards casual gaming and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service   today  video game development requires numerous interdisciplinary skills  vision  teamwork  and liaisons between different parties  including developers  publishers  distributors  retailers  hardware manufacturers  and other marketers  to successfully bring a game to its consumers  as of       the global video game market had estimated annual revenues of us     billion across hardware  software  and services  which is three times the size of the global music industry and four times that of the film industry in          making it a formidable heavyweight across the modern entertainment industry  the video game market is also a major influence behind the electronics industry  where personal computer component  console  and peripheral sales  as well as consumer demands for better game performance  have been powerful driving factors for hardware design and innovation   origins main articles  history of video games and early history of video games further information  history of arcade video games  tennis for two         an early analog computer game that used an oscilloscope for a display early video games use interactive electronic devices with various display formats  the earliest example is from     â€”a  cathode ray tube amusement device  was filed for a patent on    january       by thomas t  goldsmith jr  and estle ray mann  and issued on    december       as u s  patent             inspired by radar display technology  it consists of an analog device allowing a user to control the parabolic arc of a dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets  which are paper drawings fixed to the screen     other early examples include christopher strachey s draughts game  the nimrod computer at the      festival of britain  oxo  a tic tac toe computer game by alexander s  douglas for the edsac in       tennis for two  an electronic interactive game engineered by william higinbotham in       and spacewar   written by massachusetts institute of technology students martin graetz  steve russell  and wayne wiitanen s on a dec pdp   computer in       each game has different means of display  nimrod has a panel of lights to play the game of nim     oxo has a graphical display to play tic tac toe     tennis for two has an oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court     and spacewar  has the dec pdp   s vector display to have two spaceships battle each other       ralph h  baer  left  receiving the national medal of technology from u s  president george w  bush in      nolan bushnell giving a speech at the game developers conference in      nolan bushnell in      these preliminary inventions paved the way for the origins of video games today  ralph h  baer  while working at sanders associates in       devised a control system to play a rudimentary game of table tennis on a television screen  with the company s approval  baer built the prototype  brown box   sanders patented baer s inventions and licensed them to magnavox  which commercialized it as the first home video game console  the magnavox odyssey  released in             separately  nolan bushnell and ted dabney  inspired by seeing spacewar  running at stanford university  devised a similar version running in a smaller coin operated arcade cabinet using a less expensive computer  this was released as computer space  the first arcade video game  in          bushnell and dabney went on to form atari  inc   and with allan alcorn  created their second arcade game in       the hit ping pong style pong  which was directly inspired by the table tennis game on the odyssey  sanders and magnavox sued atari for infringement of baer s patents  but atari settled out of court  paying for perpetual rights to the patents  following their agreement  atari made a home version of pong  which was released by christmas          the success of the odyssey and pong  both as an arcade game and home machine  launched the video game industry         both baer and bushnell have been titled  father of video games  for their contributions           terminology the term  video game  was developed to distinguish this class of electronic games that were played on some type of video display rather than on a teletype printer or similar device      this also distinguished from many handheld electronic games like merlin which commonly used led lights for indicators but did not use these in combination for imaging purposes        computer game  may also be used as a descriptor  as all these types of games essentially require the use of a computer processor  and in some cases  it is used interchangeably with  video game       particularly in the united kingdom and western europe  this is common due to the historic relevance of domestically produced microcomputers  other terms used include digital game  for example by the australian bureau of statistics      however  the term  computer game  can also be used to more specifically refer to games played primarily on personal computers or other type of flexible hardware systems  also known as a pc game   as a way distinguish them from console games or mobile games          other terms such as  television game  or  telegame  had been used in the     s and early     s  particularly for the home consoles that connect to a television set      in japan  where consoles like the odyssey were first imported and then made within the country by the large television manufacturers such as toshiba and sharp corporation  such games are known as  tv games   or tv geemu or terebi geemu       electronic game  may also be used to refer to video games  but this also incorporates devices like early handheld electronic games that lack any video output      and the term  tv game  is still commonly used into the   st century           the first appearance of the term  video game  emerged around       the oxford english dictionary cited a november          businessweek article as the first printed use of the term      though bushnell believed the term came from a vending magazine review of computer space in           a review of the major vending magazines vending times and cashbox showed that the term came much earlier  appearing first around march      in these magazines in mass usage including by the arcade game manufacturers  as analyzed by video game historian keith smith  the sudden appearance suggested that the term had been proposed and readily adopted by those involved  this appeared to trace to ed adlum  who ran cashbox s coin operated section until      and then later founded replay magazine  covering the coin op amusement field  in       in a september      issue of replay  adlum is credited with first naming these games as  video games    replay s eddie adlum worked at  cash box  when  tv games  first came out  the personalities in those days were bushnell  his sales manager pat karns and a handful of other  tv game  manufacturers like henry leyser and the mcewan brothers  it seemed awkward to call their products  tv games   so borrowing a word from billboard s description of movie jukeboxes  adlum started to refer to this new breed of amusement machine as  video games   the phrase stuck   citation needed  adlum explained in      that up until the early     s  amusement arcades typically had non video arcade games such as pinball machines and electro mechanical games  with the arrival of video games in arcades during the early     s  there was initially some confusion in the arcade industry over what term should be used to describe the new games  he  wrestled with descriptions of this type of game   alternating between  tv game  and  television game  but  finally woke up one day  and said   what the hell    video game        for many years  the traveling videotopia exhibit served as the closest representation of such a vital resource  in addition to collecting home video game consoles  the electronics conservancy organization set out to locate and restore     antique arcade cabinets after realizing that the majority of these games had been destroyed and feared the loss of their historical significance      video games have significantly began to be seen in the real world as a purpose to present history in a way of understanding the methodology and terms that are being compared  researchers have looked at how historical representations affect how the public perceives the past  and digital humanists encourage historians to use video games as primary materials      video games  considering their past and age  have over time progressed as what a video game really means  whether played through a monitor  tv  or a hand held device  there are many ways that video games are being displayed for users to enjoy  people have drawn comparisons between flow state engaged video gamers and pupils in conventional school settings  in traditional  teacher led classrooms  students have little say in what they learn  are passive consumers of the information selected by teachers  are required to follow the pace and skill level of the group  group teaching   and receive brief  imprecise  normative feedback on their work      video games  as they continue to develop into better graphic definition and genre s  create new terminology when something unknown tends to become known  yearly  consoles are being created to compete against other brands with similar functioning features that tends to lead the consumer into which they d like to purchase  now  companies have moved towards games only the specific console can play to grasp the consumer into purchasing their product compared to when video games first began  there was little to no variety  in       a console war begun with nintendo  one of the biggest in gaming was up against target  sega with their brand new master system which  failed to compete  allowing the nintendo emulator system to be one of the most consumed product in the world      more technology continued to be created  as the computer began to be used in people s houses for more than just office and daily use  games began being implemented into computers and have progressively grown since then with coded robots to play against you  early games like tic tac toe  solitaire  and tennis for two were great ways to bring new gaming to another system rather than one specifically meant for gaming       definition while many games readily fall into a clear  well understood definition of video games  new genres and innovations in game development have raised the question of what are the essential factors of a video game that separate the medium from other forms of entertainment   the introduction of interactive films in the     s with games like dragon s lair  featured games with full motion video played off a form of media but only limited user interaction      this had required a means to distinguish these games from more traditional board games that happen to also use external media  such as the clue vcr mystery game which required players to watch vcr clips between turns  to distinguish between these two  video games are considered to require some interactivity that affects the visual display       most video games tend to feature some type of victory or winning conditions  such as a scoring mechanism or a final boss fight  the introduction of walking simulators  adventure games that allow for exploration but lack any objectives  like gone home  and empathy games  video games that tend to focus on emotion  like that dragon  cancer brought the idea of games that did not have any such type of winning condition and raising the question of whether these were actually games      these are still commonly justified as video games as they provide a game world that the player can interact with by some means       the lack of any industry definition for a video game by      was an issue during the case epic games v  apple which dealt with video games offered on apple s ios app store  among concerns raised were games like fortnite creative and roblox which created metaverses of interactive experiences  and whether the larger game and the individual experiences themselves were games or not in relation to fees that apple charged for the app store  judge yvonne gonzalez rogers  recognizing that there was yet an industry standard definition for a video game  established for her ruling that  at a bare minimum  videogames appear to require some level of interactivity or involvement between the player and the medium  compared to passive entertainment like film  music  and television  and  videogames are also generally graphically rendered or animated  as opposed to being recorded live or via motion capture as in films or television       rogers still concluded that what is a video game  appears highly eclectic and diverse        video game terminology see also  glossary of video game terms  freedoom  a clone of the first person shooter doom  common elements include a heads up display along the bottom that includes the player s remaining health and ammunition  the gameplay experience varies radically between video games  but many common elements exist  most games will launch into a title screen and give the player a chance to review options such as the number of players before starting a game  most games are divided into levels which the player must work the avatar through  scoring points  collecting power ups to boost the avatar s innate attributes  all while either using special attacks to defeat enemies or moves to avoid them  this information is relayed to the player through a type of on screen user interface such as a heads up display atop the rendering of the game itself  taking damage will deplete their avatar s health  and if that falls to zero or if the avatar otherwise falls into an impossible to escape location  the player will lose one of their lives  should they lose all their lives without gaining an extra life or    up   then the player will reach the  game over  screen  many levels as well as the game s finale end with a type of boss character the player must defeat to continue on  in some games  intermediate points between levels will offer save points where the player can create a saved game on storage media to restart the game should they lose all their lives or need to stop the game and restart at a later time  these also may be in the form of a passage that can be written down and reentered at the title screen   product flaws include software bugs which can manifest as glitches which may be exploited by the player  this is often the foundation of speedrunning a video game  these bugs  along with cheat codes  easter eggs  and other hidden secrets that were intentionally added to the game can also be exploited                  on some consoles  cheat cartridges allow players to execute these cheat codes  and user developed trainers allow similar bypassing for computer software games  both of which might make the game easier  give the player additional power ups  or change the appearance of the game       components  arcade video game machines at the sugoi arcade game hall in malmi  helsinki  finland to

to operate      the term system is also commonly used  games are typically designed to be played on one or a limited number of platforms  and exclusivity to a platform is used as a competitive edge in the video game market      however  games may be developed for alternative platforms than intended  which are described as ports or conversions  these also may be remasters   where most of the original game s source code is reused and art assets  models  and game levels are updated for modern systems â€“ and remakes  where in addition to asset improvements  significant reworking of the

computer game most computer games are pc games  referring to those that involve a player interacting with a personal computer  pc  connected to a video monitor      personal computers are not dedicated game platforms  so there may be differences running the same game on different hardware  also  the openness allows some features to developers like reduced software cost      increased flexibility  increased innovation  emulation  creation of modifications or mods  open hosting for online gaming  in which a person plays a video game with people who are in a different household  and others  a gaming computer is a pc or laptop intended specifically for gaming  typically using high performance  high cost components  in additional to personal computer gaming  there also exist games that work on mainframe computers and other similarly shared systems  with users logging in remotely to use the computer  home console  the playstation   is the best selling video game console  with over     million units sold      a console game is played on a home console  a specialized electronic device that connects to a common television set or composite video monitor  home consoles are specifically designed to play games using a dedicated hardware environment  giving developers a concrete hardware target for development and assurances of what features will be available  simplifying development compared to pc game development  usually consoles only run games developed for it  or games from other platform made by the same company  but never games developed by its direct competitor  even if the same game is available on different platforms  it often comes with a specific game controller  major console platforms include xbox  playstation and nintendo  handheld console a handheld game console is a small  self contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in a user s hands  it features the console  a small screen  speakers and buttons  joystick or other game controllers in a single unit  like consoles  handhelds are dedicated platforms  and share almost the same characteristics  handheld hardware usually is less powerful than pc or console hardware  some handheld games from the late     s and early     s could only play one game  in the     s and     s  a number of handheld games used cartridges  which enabled them to be used to play many different games  the handheld console has waned in the     s as mobile device gaming has become a more dominant factor  arcade video game  a police themed arcade game in which players use a light gun an arcade video game generally refers to a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special  large coin operated cabinet which has one built in console  controllers  joystick  buttons  etc    a crt screen  and audio amplifier and speakers  arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating to the theme of the game  while most arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet  which the user typically stands in front of to play  some arcade games use a tabletop approach  in which the display screen is housed in a table style cabinet with a see through table top  with table top games  the users typically sit to play  in the     s and     s  some arcade games offered players a choice of multiple games  in the     s  video arcades were businesses in which game players could use a number of arcade video games  in the     s  there are far fewer video arcades  but some movie theaters and family entertainment centers still have them  browser game a browser game takes advantages of standardizations of technologies for the functionality of web browsers across multiple devices providing a cross platform environment  these games may be identified based on the website that they appear  such as with miniclip games  others are named based on the programming platform used to develop them  such as java and flash games  mobile game with the introduction of smartphones and tablet computers standardized on the ios and android operating systems  mobile gaming has become a significant platform  these games may use unique features of mobile devices that are not necessary present on other platforms  such as accelerometers  global positing information and camera devices to support augmented reality gameplay  cloud gaming cloud gaming requires a minimal hardware device  such as a basic computer  console  laptop  mobile phone or even a dedicated hardware device connected to a display with good internet connectivity that connects to hardware systems by the cloud gaming provider  the game is computed and rendered on the remote hardware  using a number of predictive methods to reduce the network latency between player input and output on their display device  for example  the xbox cloud gaming and playstation now platforms use dedicated custom server blade hardware in cloud computing centers  virtual reality  players using the playstation vr headsets in      virtual reality  vr  games generally require players to use a special head mounted unit that provides stereoscopic screens and motion tracking to immerse a player within virtual environment that responds to their head movements  some vr systems include control units for the player s hands as to provide a direct way to interact with the virtual world  vr systems generally require a separate computer  console  or other processing device that couples with the head mounted unit  emulation an emulator enables games from a console or otherwise different system to be run in a type of virtual machine on a modern system  simulating the hardware of the original and allows old games to be played  while emulators themselves have been found to be legal in united states case law  the act of obtaining the game software that one does not already own may violate copyrights  however  there are some official releases of emulated software from game manufacturers  such as nintendo with its virtual console or nintendo switch online offerings  backward compatibility backward compatibility is similar in nature to emulation in that older games can be played on newer platforms  but typically directly though hardware and build in software within the platform  for example  the playstation   is capable of playing original playstation games simply by inserting the original game media into the newer console  while nintendo s wii could play gamecube titles as well in the same manner  game media  an unlabeled game cartridge for the nintendo entertainment system early arcade games  home consoles  and handheld games were dedicated hardware units with the game s logic built into the electronic componentry of the hardware  since then  most video game platforms are considered programmable  having means to read and play multiple games distributed on different types of media or formats  physical formats include rom cartridges  magnetic storage including magnetic tape data storage and floppy discs  optical media formats including cd rom and dvds  and flash memory cards  furthermore digital distribution over the internet or other communication methods as well as cloud gaming alleviate the need for any physical media  in some cases  the media serves as the direct read only memory for the game  or it may be the form of installation media that is used to write the main assets to the player s platform s local storage for faster loading periods and later updates   games can be extended with new content and software patches through either expansion packs which are typically available as physical media  or as downloadable content nominally available via digital distribution  these can be offered freely or can be used to monetize a game following its initial release  several games offer players the ability to create user generated content to share with others to play  other games  mostly those on personal computers  can be extended with user created modifications or mods that alter or add onto the game  these often are unofficial and were developed by players from reverse engineering of the game  but other games provide official support for modding the game       input device main article  game controller  a north american super nes game controller from the early     s video game can use several types of input devices to translate human actions to a game  most common are the use of game controllers like gamepads and joysticks for most consoles  and as accessories for personal computer systems along keyboard and mouse controls  common controls on the most recent controllers include face buttons  shoulder triggers  analog sticks  and directional pads   d pads    consoles typically include standard controllers which are shipped or bundled with the console itself  while peripheral controllers are available as a separate purchase from the console manufacturer or third party vendors      similar control sets are built into handheld consoles and onto arcade cabinets  newer technology improvements have incorporated additional technology into the controller or the game platform  such as touchscreens and motion detection sensors that give more options for how the player interacts with the game  specialized controllers may be used for certain genres of games  including racing wheels  light guns and dance pads  digital cameras and motion detection can capture movements of the player as input into the game  which can  in some cases  effectively eliminate the control  and on other systems such as virtual reality  are used to enhance immersion into the game   display and output main article  video game graphics  handheld units  like the game boy  include built in output screens and sound speakers  by definition  all video games are intended to output graphics to an external video display  such as cathode ray tube televisions  newer liquid crystal display  lcd  televisions and built in screens  projectors or computer monitors  depending on the type of platform the game is played on  features such as color depth  refresh rate  frame rate  and screen resolution are a combination of the limitations of the game platform and display device and the program efficiency of the game itself  the game s output can range from fixed displays using led or lcd elements  text based games  two dimensional and three dimensional graphics  and augmented reality displays   the game s graphics are often accompanied by sound produced by internal speakers on the game platform or external speakers attached to the platform  as directed by the game s programming  this often will include sound effects tied to the player s actions to provide audio feedback  as well as background music for the game   some platforms support additional feedback mechanics to the player that a game can take advantage of  this is most commonly haptic technology built into the game controller  such as causing the controller to shake in the player s hands to simulate a shaking earthquake occurring in game   classifications video games are frequently classified by a number of factors related to how one plays them   genre main article  video game genre see also  gameplay dustforce is representative of the platform game genre as its gameplay involves jumping between platforms  a video game  like most other forms of media  may be categorized into genres  however  unlike film or television which use visual or narrative elements  video games are generally categorized into genres based on their gameplay interaction  since this is the primary means which one interacts with a video game              the narrative setting does not impact gameplay  a shooter game is still a shooter game  regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in outer space          an exception is the horror game genre  used for games that are based on narrative elements of horror fiction  the supernatural  and psychological horror       genre names are normally self describing in terms of the type of gameplay  such as action game  role playing game  or shoot  em up  though some genres have derivations from influential works that have defined that genre  such as roguelikes from rogue      grand theft auto clones from grand theft auto iii      and battle royale games from the film battle royale      the names may shift over time as players  developers and the media come up with new terms  for example  first person shooters were originally called  doom clones  based on the      game      a hierarchy of game genres exist  with top level genres like  shooter game  and  action game  that broadly capture the game s main gameplay style  and several subgenres of specific implementation  such as within the shooter game first person shooter and third person shooter  some cross genre types also exist that fall until multiple top level genres such as action adventure game   mode  a lan party at the      dreamhack with hundreds of players a video game s mode describes how many players can use the game at the same type  this is primarily distinguished by single player video games and multiplayer video games  within the latter category  multiplayer games can be played in a variety of ways  including locally at the same device  on separate devices connected through a local network such as lan parties  or online via separate internet connections  most multiplayer games are based on competitive gameplay  but many offer cooperative and team based options as well as asymmetric gameplay  online games use server structures that can also enable massively multiplayer online games  mmos  to support hundreds of players at the same time   a small number of video games are zero player games  in which the player has very limited interaction with the game itself  these are most commonly simulation games where the player may establish a starting state and then let the game proceed on its own  watching the results as a passive observer  such as with many computerized simulations of conway s game of life       types most video games are intended for entertainment purposes      different game types include   casual games casual games are designed for ease of accessibility  simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp rule sets  and aimed at mass market audience  they frequently support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand  such as during commuting or lunch breaks  numerous browser and mobile games fall into the casual game area  and casual games often are from genres with low intensity game elements such as match three  hidden object  time management  and puzzle games      causal games frequently use social network game mechanics  where players can enlist the help of friends on their social media networks for extra turns or moves each day      popular casual games include tetris and candy crush saga  more recent  starting in the late     s  are hyper casual games which use even more simplistic rules for short but infinitely replayable games  such as flappy bird      this is as opposed to core games or hardcore games  which are designed for committed players  their game mechanics are challenging and playing them is complex  educational games education software has been used in homes and classrooms to help teach children and students  and video games have been similarly adapted for these reasons  all designed to provide a form of interactivity and entertainment tied to game design elements  there are a variety of differences in their designs and how they educate the user  these are broadly split between edutainment games that tend to focus on the entertainment value and rote learning but are unlikely to engage in critical thinking  and educational video games that are geared towards problem solving through motivation and positive reinforcement while downplaying the entertainment value      examples of educational games include the oregon trail and the carmen sandiego series  further  games not initially developed for educational purposes have found their way into the classroom after release  such as that feature open worlds or virtual sandboxes like minecraft      or offer critical thinking skills through puzzle video games like spacechem      serious games  microsoft flight simulator is an example of a simulation game  further extending from educational games  serious games are those where the entertainment factor may be augmented  overshadowed  or even eliminated by other purposes for the game  game design is used to reinforce the non entertainment purpose of the game  such as using video game technology for the game s interactive world  or gamification for reinforcement training  educational games are a form of serious games  but other types of games include fitness games that incorporate significant physical exercise to help keep the player fit  such as wii fit   simulator games that resemble fight simulators to pilot aircraft  such as microsoft flight simulator   advergames that are built around the advertising of a product  such as pepsiman   and newsgames aimed at conveying a specific advocacy message  such as narcoguerra           art games although video games have been considered an art form on their own  games may be developed to try to purposely communicate a story or message  using the medium as a work of art  these art or arthouse games are designed to generate emotion and empathy from the player by challenging societal norms and offering critique through the interactivity of the video game medium  they may not have any type of win condition and are designed to let the player explore through the game world and scenarios  most art games are indie games in nature  designed based on personal experiences or stories through a single developer or small team  examples of art games include passage  flower  and that dragon  cancer              content rating main article  video game content rating system  a typical esrb rating label  listing the rating and specific content descriptors for rabbids go home video games can be subject to national and international content rating requirements  like with film content ratings  video game ratings typing identify the target age group that the national or regional ratings board believes is appropriate for the player  ranging from all ages  to a teenager or older  to mature  to the infrequent adult only games  most content review is based on the level of violence  both in the type of violence and how graphic it may be represented  and sexual content  but other themes such as drug and alcohol use and gambling that can influence children may also be identified  a primary identifier based on a minimum age is used by nearly all systems  along with additional descriptors to identify specific content that players and parents should be aware of   the regulations vary from country to country but generally are voluntary systems upheld by vendor practices  with penalty and fines issued by the ratings body on the video game publisher for misuse of the ratings  among the major content rating systems include   entertainment software rating board  esrb  that oversees games released in the united states  esrb ratings are voluntary and rated along a e  everyone   e     everyone    and older   t  teen   m  mature   and ao  adults only   attempts to mandate video games ratings in the u s  subsequently led to the landmark supreme court case  brown v

united kingdom  most of the european union and other european countries  replacing previous national based systems  the pegi system uses content rated based on minimum recommended ages  which include

law  and importantly  games cannot be imported or purchased digitally in australia if they have failed to gain a rating or were given the rc rating  leading to a number of notable banned games  computer entertainment rating organization  cero  rates games for japan  their ratings include a  all ages   b     and older   c     and over   d     and over   and z     and over   additionally  the major content system provides have worked to create the international age rating coalition  iarc   a means to streamline and align the content ratings system between different region  so that a publisher would only need to complete the content ratings review for one provider  and use the iarc transition to affirm the content rating for all other regions   certain nations have even more restrictive rules related to political or ideological content  within germany  until       the unterhaltungssoftware selbstkontrolle  entertainment software self regulation  would refuse to classify  and thus allow sale  of any game depicting nazi imagery  and thus often requiring developers to replace such imagery with fictional ones  this ruling was relaxed in      to allow for such imagery for

there must adhere to strict government review  disallowing content such as smearing the image of the chinese communist party  foreign games published in china often require modification by developers and publishers to meet these requirements       development main article  video game development see also  video game industry practices  developers use various tools to create video games  here an editor is fine tuning the virtual camera system  video game development and authorship  much like any other form of entertainment  is frequently a cross disciplinary field  video game developers  as employees within this industry are commonly referred  primarily include programmers and graphic designers  over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program  including sound designers  musicians  and other technicians  as well as skills that are specific to video games  such as the game designer  all of these are managed by producers   in the early days of the industry  it was more common for a single person to manage all of the roles needed to create a video game  as platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material they can present  larger teams have been needed to generate all of the art  programming  cinematography  and more  this is not to say that the age of the  one man shop  is gone  as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets      where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited ram or lack of dedicated  d graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform  e g   some pdas        video games are programmed like any other piece of computer software  prior to the mid     s  arcade and home consoles were programmed by assembling discrete electro mechanical components on circuit boards  which limited games to relatively simple logic  by       low cost microprocessors were available at volume to be used for video game hardware  which allowed game developers to program more detailed games  widening the scope of what was possible          ongoing improvements in computer hardware technology has expanded what has become possible to create in video games  coupled with convergence of common hardware between console  computer  and arcade platforms to simplify the development process      today  game developers have a number of commercial and open source tools available for use to make games  often which are across multiple platforms to support portability  or may still opt to create their own for more specialized features and direct control of the game  today  many games are built around a game engine that handles the bulk of the game s logic  gameplay  and rendering  these engines can be augmented with specialized engines for specific features  such as a physics engine that simulates the physics of objects in real time  a variety of middleware exists to help developers to access other features  such as for playback of videos within games  network oriented code for games that communicate via online services  matchmaking for online games  and similar features  these features can be used from a developers  programming language of choice  or they may opt to also use game development kits that minimize the amount of direct programming they have to do but can also limit the amount of customization they can add into a game  like all software  video games usually undergo quality testing before release to assure there are no bugs or glitches in the product  though frequently developers will release patches and updates   with the growth of the size of development teams in the industry  the problem of cost has increased  development studios need the best talent  while publishers reduce costs to maintain profitability on their investment  typically  a video game console development team ranges from   to    people  and some exceed      in may       assassin s creed ii was reported to have a development staff of          the growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines  rushed games and the release of unfinished products       while amateur and hobbyist game programming had existed since the late     s with the introduction of home computers  a newer trend since the mid     s is indie game development  indie games are made by small teams outside any direct publisher control  their games being smaller in scope than those from the larger  aaa  game studios  and are often experiment in gameplay and art style  indie game development are aided by larger availability of digital distribution  including the newer mobile gaming marker  and readily available and low cost development tools for these platforms       game theory and studies main article  game studies although departments of computer science have been studying the technical aspects of video games for years  theories that examine games as an artistic medium are a relatively recent development in the humanities  the two most visible schools in this emerging field are ludology and narratology  narrativists approach video games in the context of what janet murray calls  cyberdrama   that is to say  their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium  one that arises out of interactive fiction  murray puts video games in the context of the holodeck  a fictional piece of technology from star trek  arguing for the video game as a medium in which the player is allowed to become another person  and to act out in another world      this image of video games received early widespread popular support  and forms the basis of films such as tron  existenz and the last starfighter   ludologists break sharply and radically from this idea  they argue that a video game is first and foremost a game  which must be understood in terms of its rules  interface  and the concept of play that it deploys  espen j  aarseth argues that  although games certainly have plots  characters  and aspects of traditional narratives  these aspects are incidental to gameplay  for example  aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game tomb raider  saying that  the dimensions of lara croft s body  already analyzed to death by film theorists  are irrelevant to me as a player  because a different looking body would not make me play differently    when i play  i don t even see her body  but see through it and past it       simply put  ludologists reject traditional theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the underlying set of rules  demands  and expectations imposed on the player   while many games rely on emergent principles  video games commonly present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within the context of the game  the term  emergent narrative  has been used to describe how  in a simulated environment  storyline can be created simply by  what happens to the player       however  emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games  in general  any place where event driven instructions occur for ai in a game  emergent behavior will exist  for instance  take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing  and they encounter an obstacle in the track  the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle  the programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam  yet one now exists in the game   intellectual property for video games main articles  intellectual property protection of video games and video game clone most commonly  video games are protected by copyright  though both patents and trademarks have been used as well   though local copyright regulations vary to the degree of protection  video games qualify as copyrighted visual audio works  and enjoy cross country protection under the berne convention      this typically only applies to the underlying code  as well as to the artistic aspects of the game such as its writing  art assets  and music  gameplay itself is generally not considered copyrightable  in the united states among other countries  video games are considered to fall into the ideaâ€“expression distinction in that it is how the game is presented and expressed to the player that can be copyrighted  but not the underlying principles of the game       because gameplay is normally ineligible for copyright  gameplay ideas in popular games are often replicated and built upon in other games  at times  this repurposing of gameplay can be seen as beneficial and a fundamental part of how the industry has grown by building on the ideas of others          for example doom        and grand theft auto iii        introduced gameplay that created popular new game genres  the first person shooter and the grand theft auto clone  respectively  in the few years after their release          however  at times and more frequently at the onset of the industry  developers would intentionally create video game clones of successful games and game hardware with few changes  which led to the flooded arcade and dedicated home console market around                   cloning is also a major issue with countries that do not have strong intellectual property protection laws  such as within china  the lax oversight by china s government and the difficulty for foreign companies to take chinese entities to court had enabled china to support a large grey market of cloned hardware and software systems      the industry remains challenged to distinguish between creating new games based on refinements of past successful games to create a new type of gameplay  and intentionally creating a clone of a game that may simply swap out art assets       industry main article  video game industry  e  is one of the typical trade show events of the video game industry  history the early history of the video game industry  following the first game hardware releases and through       had little structure  video games quickly took off during the golden age of arcade video games from the late     s to early     s  but the newfound industry was mainly composed of game developers with little business experience  this led to numerous companies forming simply to create clones of popular games to try to capitalize on the market      due to loss of publishing control and oversaturation of the market  the north american home video game market crashed in       dropping from revenues of around    billion in      to      million by       many of the north american companies created in the prior years closed down  japan s growing game industry was briefly shocked by this crash but had sufficient longevity to withstand the short term effects  and nintendo helped to revitalize the industry with the release of the nintendo entertainment system in north america in           along with it  nintendo established a number of core industrial practices to prevent unlicensed game development and control game distribution on their platform  methods that continue to be used by console manufacturers today       the industry remained more conservative following the      crash  forming around the concept of publisher developer dichotomies  and by the     s  leading to the industry centralizing around low risk  triple a games and studios with large development budgets of at least     million or more      the advent of the internet brought digital distribution as a viable means to distribute games  and contributed to the growth of more riskier  experimental independent game development as an alternative to triple a games in the late     s and which has continued to grow as a significant portion of the video game industry           industry roles video games have a large network effect that draw on many different sectors that tie into the larger video game industry  while video game developers are a significant portion of the industry  other key participants in the market include       publishers  companies generally that oversee bringing the game from the developer to market  this often includes performing the marketing  public relations  and advertising of the game  publishers frequently pay the developers ahead of time to make their games and will be involved in critical decisions about the direction of the game s progress  and then pay the developers additional royalties or bonuses based on sales performances  other smaller  boutique publishers may simply offer to perform the publishing of a game for a small fee and a portion of the sales  and otherwise leave the developer with the creative freedom to proceed  a range of other publisher developer relationships exist between these points  distributors  publishers often are able to produce their own game media and take the role of distributor  but there are also third party distributors that can mass produce game media and distribute to retailers  digital storefronts like steam and the ios app store also serve as distributors and retailers in the digital space  retailers  physical storefronts  which include large online retailers  department and electronic stores  and specialty video game stores  sell games  consoles  and other accessories to consumers  this has also including a trade in market in certain regions  allowing players to turn in used games for partial refunds or credit towards other games  however  with the uprising of digital marketplaces and e commerce revolution  retailers have been performing worse than in the past  hardware manufacturers  the video game console manufacturers produce console hardware  often through a value chain system that include numerous component suppliers and contract manufacturer that assemble the consoles  further  these console manufacturers typically require a license to develop for their platform and may control the production of some games  such as nintendo does with the use of game cartridges for its systems  in exchange  the manufacturers may help promote games for their system and may seek console exclusivity for certain games  for games on personal computers  a number of manufacturers are devoted to high performance  gaming computer  hardware  particularly in the graphics card area  several of the same companies overlap with component supplies for consoles  a range of third party manufacturers also exist to provide equipment and gear for consoles post sale  such as additional controllers for console or carrying cases and gear for handheld devices  journalism  while journalism around video games used to be primarily print based  and focused more on post release reviews and gameplay strategy  the internet has brought a more proactive press that use web journalism  covering games in the months prior to release as well as beyond  helping to build excitement for games ahead of release  influencers  with the rising importance of social media  video game companies have found that the opinions of influencers using streaming media to play through their games has had a significant impact on game sales  and have turned to use influencers alongside traditional journalism as a means to build up attention to their game before release  esports  esports is a major function of several multiplayer games with numerous professional leagues established since the     s  with large viewership numbers  particularly out of southeast asia since the     s  trade and advocacy groups  trade groups like the entertainment software association were established to provide a common voice for the industry in response to governmental and other advocacy concerns  they frequently set up the major trade events and conventions for the industry such as e   gamers  the players and consumers of video games  broadly  while their representation in the industry is primarily seen through game sales  many companies follow gamers  comments on social media or on user reviews and engage with them to work to improve their products in addition to other feedback from other parts of the industry  demographics of the larger player community also impact parts of the market  while once dominated by younger men  the market shifted in the mid     s towards women and older players who generally preferred mobile and causal games  leading to further growth in those sectors      these gamers are allowed to influence how the game can update in the future for further development of a better game  major regional markets see also  video game industry â§ international practices the industry itself grew out from both the united states and japan in the     s and     s before having a larger worldwide contribution  today  the video game industry is predominantly led by major companies in north america  primarily the united states and canada   europe  and southeast asia including japan  south korea  and china  hardware production remains an area dominated by asian companies either directly involved in hardware design or part of the production process  but digital distribution

subculture formed around video games and game playing  as computer and video games have increased in popularity over time  they have had a significant influence on popular culture  video game culture has also evolved over time hand in hand with internet culture as well as the increasing popularity of mobile games  many people who play video games identify as gamers  which can mean anything from someone who enjoys games to someone who is passionate about it  as video games become more social with multiplayer and online capability  gamers find themselves in growing social networks  gaming can both be entertainment as well as competition  as a new trend known as electronic sports is becoming more widely accepted  in the     s  video games and discussions of video game trends and topics can

means of social distancing             main article  video games as an art form since the mid     s there has been debate whether video games qualify as art  primarily as the form s interactivity interfered with the artistic intent of the work and that they are designed for commercial appeal  a significant debate on the matter came after film critic roger ebert published an essay  video games can never be art        which challenged the industry to prove him and other critics wrong       the view that video games were an art form was cemented in      when the u s  supreme court ruled in the landmark case brown v  entertainment merchants association that video games were a protected form of speech with artistic merit       since then  video game developers have come to use the form more for artistic expression  including the development of art games       and the cultural heritage of video games as works of arts  beyond their technical capabilities  have been part of major

hollywood and the video game industry video games will inspire sequels and other video games within the same franchise  but also have influenced works outside of the video game medium  numerous television shows  both animated and live action   films  comics and novels have been created based on existing video game franchises  because video games are an interactive medium there has been trouble in converting them to these passive forms of media  and typically such works have been critically panned or treated as children s media  for example  until       no video game film had ever been received a  fresh  rating on rotten tomatoes  but the releases of detective pikachu        and sonic the hedgehog         both receiving  fresh  ratings  shows signs of the film industry having found an approach to adapt video games for the large screen            that said  some early video game based films have been highly successful at the box office  such as      s mortal kombat and      s lara croft  tomb raider        more recently since the     s  there has also become a larger appreciation of video game music  which ranges from chiptunes composed for limited sound output devices on early computers and consoles  to fully scored compositions for most modern games  such music has frequently served as a platform for covers and remixes  and concerts featuring video game soundtracks performed by bands or orchestras  such as video games live  have also become popular       video games also frequently incorporate licensed music  particularly in the area of rhythm games  furthering the depth of which video games and music can work together        further  video games can serve as a virtual environment under full control of a producer to create new works  with the

these licensed games in the     s and     s often had a reputation for poor quality  developed without any input from the intellectual property rights owners  and several of them are considered among lists of games with notably negative reception  such as superman     more recently  with these licensed games being developed by triple a studios or through studios directly connected to the licensed

education and video game behavioral effects besides their entertainment value  appropriately designed video games have been seen to provide value in education across several ages and comprehension levels  learning principles found in video games have been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the u s  education system       it has been noticed that gamers adopt an attitude while playing that is of such high concentration  they do not realize they are learning  and that if the same attitude could be adopted at school  education would enjoy significant benefits       students are found to be  learning by doing  while playing video games while fostering creative thinking        video games are also believed to be beneficial to the mind and body  it has been shown that action video game players have better handâ€“eye coordination and visuo motor skills  such as their resistance to distraction  their sensitivity to information in the peripheral vision and their ability to count briefly presented objects  than nonplayers       researchers found that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with action games  involving challenges that switch attention between different locations  but not with games requiring concentration on single objects  a      systematic review found evidence that video gaming training had positive effects on cognitive and emotional skills in the adult population  especially with young adults       a      systematic review also added support for the claim that video games are beneficial to the brain  although the beneficial effects of video gaming on the brain differed by video games types        organisers of video gaming events  such as the organisers of the d lux video game festival in dumfries  scotland  have emphasised the positive aspects video games can have on mental health  organisers  mental health workers and mental health nurses at the event emphasised the relationships and friendships that can be built around video games and how playing games can help people learn about others as a precursor to discussing the person s mental health       a study in      from oxford university also suggested that playing video games can be a benefit to a person s mental health  the report of       gamers  all over the age of     focused on the games animal crossing  new horizons and plants vs zombies  battle for neighborville and used actual play time data  the report found that those that played more games tended to report greater  wellbeing             also in       computer science professor regan mandryk of the university of saskatchewan said her research also showed that video games can have health benefits such as reducing stress and improving mental health  the university s research studied all age groups â€“  from pre literate children through to older adults living in long term care homes  â€“ with a main focus on    to    year olds        a study of gamers attitudes towards gaming which was reported about in      found that millennials use video games as a key strategy for coping with stress  in the study of       gamers      said that it  helps

have had controversy since the     s  video games have emerged as one of the primary playthings used by youngsters all over the world  citation needed  parents and children s advocates have raised concerns that violent video games can influence young players into performing those violent acts in real life  and events such as the columbine high school massacre in      in which the perpetrators specifically alluded to using video games to plot out their attack  raised further fears  medical experts and mental health professionals have also raised concerned that video games may be addictive  and the world health organization has included  gaming disorder  in the   th revision of its international statistical classification of diseases  other health experts  including the american psychiatric association  have stated that there is insufficient evidence that video games can create violent tendencies or lead to addictive behavior       though agree that video games typically use a compulsion loop in their core design that can create dopamine that can help reinforce the desire to continue to play through that compulsion loop and potentially lead into violent or addictive behavior                 even with case law establishing that video games qualify as a protected art form  there has been pressure on the video game industry to keep their products in check to avoid over excessive violence particularly for games aimed at younger children  the potential addictive behavior around games  coupled with increased used of post sale monetization of video games  has also raised concern among parents  advocates  and government officials about gambling tendencies that may come from video games  such as controversy around the use of loot boxes in many high profile games   numerous other controversies around video games and its industry have arisen over the years  among the more notable incidents include the      united states congressional hearings on violent games like mortal kombat which lead to the formation of the esrb ratings system  numerous legal actions taken by attorney jack thompson over violent games such as grand theft auto iii and manhunt from      to       the outrage over the  no russian  level from call of duty  modern warfare   in      which allowed the player to shoot a number of innocent non player characters at an airport  and the gamergate harassment campaign in      that highlighted misogamy from a portion of the player demographic  the industry as a whole has also dealt with issues related to gender  racial  and lgbtq  discrimination and mischaracterization of these minority groups in video games  a further issue in the industry is related to working conditions  as development studios and publishers frequently use  crunch time   required extended working hours  in the weeks and months ahead of a game s release to assure on time delivery   collecting and preservation main articles  video game collecting and video

first decades  games in retail packaging in good shape have become collectors items for the early days of the industry  with some rare publications having gone for over us         as of       separately  there is also concern about the preservation of video games  as both game media and the hardware to play them degrade over time  further  many of the game developers and publishers from the first decades no longer exist  so records of their games have disappeared  archivists and preservations have worked within the scope of copyright law to save these games as part of the cultural

exhibition on  the art of video games        however  the reviews of the exhibit were mixed  including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum            wikipedia began with its first edit on    january       two days after the domain was registered    by jimmy wales and larry sanger  its technological and conceptual underpinnings predate this  the earliest known proposal for an online encyclopedia was made by rick gates in          and the concept of a free as in freedom online encyclopedia  as distinct from mere open source     was proposed by richard stallman in           crucially  stallman s concept specifically included the idea that no central organization should control editing  this characteristic greatly contrasted with contemporary digital encyclopedias such as microsoft encarta  encyclopã¦dia britannica  and even bomis s nupedia  which was wikipedia s direct predecessor  in       the license for nupedia was changed to gfdl  and wales and sanger launched wikipedia using the concept and technology of a wiki pioneered in      by ward cunningham     initially  wikipedia was intended to complement nupedia  an online encyclopedia project edited solely by experts  by providing additional draft articles and ideas for it  in practice  wikipedia quickly overtook nupedia  becoming a global project in multiple languages and inspiring a wide range of other online reference projects   wikipedia s worldwide monthly readership in      was approximately     million     worldwide in september       wmf labs tallied      billion page views for the month     according to comscore  wikipedia receives over     million monthly unique visitors from the united states alone      historical overview background the concept of compiling the world s knowledge in a single location dates back to the ancient library of alexandria and library of pergamum  but the modern concept of a general purpose  widely distributed  printed encyclopedia originated with denis diderot and the   th century french encyclopedists      the idea of using automated machinery beyond the printing press to build a more useful encyclopedia can be traced to paul otlet s      book traitã© de documentation  otlet also founded the mundaneum  an institution dedicated to indexing the world s knowledge  in       this concept of a machine assisted encyclopedia was further expanded in h  g  wells  book of essays world brain        and vannevar bush s future vision of the microfilm based memex in his essay  as we may think              another milestone was ted nelson s hypertext design project xanadu  which was begun in            the use of volunteers was integral and instrumental in creating and maintaining wikipedia  however  even without the internet  huge complex projects of similar nature had made use of volunteers  specifically  the creation of the oxford english dictionary was conceived with the speech at the london library  on guy fawkes day    november      by richard chenevix trench  it took about    years to complete  dr  trench envisioned a grand new dictionary of every word in the english language  and to be used democratically and freely  according to author simon winchester   the undertaking of the scheme  he said  was beyond the ability of any one man  to peruse all of english literatureâ€”and to comb the london and new york newspapers and the most literate of the magazines and journalsâ€”must be instead  the combined action of many   it would be necessary to recruit a teamâ€”moreover  a huge oneâ€”probably comprising hundreds and hundreds of unpaid amateurs  all of them working as volunteers        advances in information technology in the late   th century led to changes in the form of encyclopedias  while previous encyclopedias  notably the encyclopã¦dia britannica  were often book based  microsoft s encarta  published in       was available on cd rom and hyperlinked  the development of the world wide web led to many attempts to develop internet encyclopedia projects  an early proposal for an online encyclopedia was interpedia in      by rick gates     this project died before generating any encyclopedic content  free software proponent richard stallman described the usefulness of a  free universal encyclopedia and learning resource  in          his published document outlined how to  ensure that progress continues towards this best and most natural outcome   on wednesday    january       two days after the founding of wikipedia  the free software foundation s  fsf  gnupedia project went online  competing with nupedia      but today the fsf encourages people  to visit and contribute to  wikipedia         wikipedia co founder jimmy wales has stated that the germ of the concept for wikipedia  for him  came back when he was a graduate student at indiana university where he was impressed with the successes of the open source movement and found richard stallman s emacs manifesto promoting free software and a sharing economy to be quite interesting  at the time  wales was studying finance and was intrigued by the incentives of the many people who contributed as volunteers toward creating free software where there were many examples having excellent results       according to the economist  wikipedia  has its roots in the techno optimism that characterised the internet at the end of the   th century  it held that ordinary people could use their computers as tools for liberation  education  and enlightenment        formulation of the concept wikipedia was initially conceived as a feeder project for the wales founded nupedia  an earlier project to produce a free online encyclopedia  volunteered by bomis  a web advertising firm owned by jimmy wales  tim shell and michael e  davis              nupedia was founded upon the use of highly qualified volunteer contributors and an elaborate multi step peer review process      despite its mailing list of interested editors  and the presence of a full time editor in chief  larry sanger  a graduate philosophy student hired by wales      the writing of content for nupedia was extremely slow  with only    articles written during the first year       wales and sanger discussed various ways to create content more rapidly      the idea of a wiki based complement originated from a conversation between sanger and ben kovitz              ben kovitz was a computer programmer and regular on ward cunningham s revolutionary wiki  the wikiwikiweb   he explained to sanger what wikis were  at that time a difficult concept to understand  over a dinner on tuesday   january                       wales first stated  in october       that  larry had the idea to use wiki software       though he later stated in december      that jeremy rosenfeld  a bomis employee  introduced him to the concept          citation needed  citation needed  sanger thought a wiki would be a good platform to use  and proposed on the nupedia mailing list that a wiki based upon usemodwiki  then v        be set up as a  feeder  project for nupedia  under the subject  let s make a wiki   he wrote       no  this is not an indecent proposal  it s an idea to add a little feature to nupedia  jimmy wales thinks that many people might find the idea objectionable  but i think not    as to nupedia s use of a wiki  this is the ultimate  open  and simple format for developing content  we have occasionally bandied about ideas for simpler  more open projects to either replace or supplement nupedia  it seems to me wikis can be implemented practically instantly  need very little maintenance  and in general  are very low risk  they re also a potentially great source of content  so there s little downside  as far as i can determine   wales set one up and put it online on wednesday    january            founding of wikipedia see also  first wikipedia edit  wikipedia wikipedia s oldest articles  and wikipedia first     pages there was considerable resistance on the part of nupedia s editors and reviewers to the idea of associating nupedia with a wiki style website      in his message to nupedia mailing list sent on    january       sanger suggested giving the new project its own name  wikipedia      and wikipedia was soon launched on its own domain  wikipedia com  on monday    january       the bandwidth and server  located in san diego  used for these initial projects were donated by bomis  many former bomis employees later contributed content to the encyclopedia  notably tim shell  co founder and later ceo of bomis  and programmer jason richey   wales stated in december      that he made wikipedia s first edit  a test edit with the text  hello  world    but this edit may have been to an old version of wikipedia which soon after was scrapped and replaced by a restart  citation needed      the existence of the project was formally announced and an appeal for volunteers to engage in content creation was made to the nupedia mailing list on    january            the project received many new participants after being mentioned on the slashdot website in july           having already earned two minor mentions in march               it then received a prominent pointer to a story on the community edited technology and culture website kuro hin on    july      between these relatively rapid influxes of traffic  there had been a steady stream of traffic from other sources  especially google  which alone sent hundreds of new visitors to the site every day  its first major mainstream media coverage was in the new york times on    september            the project gained its      th article around monday    february      and reached        articles around   september  in the first year of

disagreed on how to handle disruptive editors  specific roles for experts  and the best way to guide the project to success   wales went on to establish self governance and bottom up self direction by editors on wikipedia  he made it clear that he would not be involved in the community s day to day management  but would encourage it to learn to self manage and find its own best approaches  as of       wales mostly restricts his own role to occasional input on serious matters  executive activity  advocacy of knowledge  and encouragement of similar reference projects   sanger says he is an  inclusionist  and is open to almost anything      he proposed that experts still have a place in the web     world  he returned briefly to academia  then joined the digital universe foundation  in
